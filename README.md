ARM templates to create resources in azure

For deploying resources in azure i have created 3 files
- storage.json
- parameters.json
- deploy.ps1

If we run deploy.ps1 script by using json files it will create storage account in azure

* Before running the ps1 script make sure to give your azure subscription id and tenant id
